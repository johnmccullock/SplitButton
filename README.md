# SplitButton
A button with two sides: left acts like a normal button, the right launches a popup menu.

SplitButton.java is based on a javax.swing.JButton, and SplitToggleButton is based on a javax.swing.JToggleButton.

I found a use for this on a vertical javax.swing.JToolBar where the button left sides activated general functions, and the right side popup menus activated more specific tasks related to the general functions.
